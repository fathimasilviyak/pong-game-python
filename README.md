Pong is a classic arcade game. 

It is one of the first arcade games that ever was. 

It has a really simple premise. 

It was created and written by Allan Alcorn.

It is basically just a ball that's going across a table, and two players each control a paddle of width 20 and heigh 100 from left and right side of the table.

Once the ball hit any of the left or right paddle, then the ball bounce back to the opposite direction.

When the ball hits on the upper or down boundaries, then also it bounce back to opposite direction.

If one player miss the ball, then the other player scores a point.

The speed of the ball increases each time the ball collide with the paddle.

Here it is implemented using a python librarty called turtle.
